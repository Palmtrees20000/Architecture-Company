" Hi, I'm Palmer Charles. Currently my major is web design and development, specializing in UX design. How far have I come along? I'm about like three years in, three and a half years. I'm almost done. I have about a year and a half left, so hopefully all will go well. How many credits am I taking so far? About 11. I know it's not 12, but it's still kind of a big workload, so hopefully I can take it."

" Where am I working currently? I am currently working at Nickel City. So if you guys know me, definitely come by and I can get you guys in for free. Obviously you gotta talk to me while I'm working. I don't think you can get in for free if I'm not there."
