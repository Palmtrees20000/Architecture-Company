" Hi, I'm Palmer Charles. Currently my 
major is web design and development,  

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.200
specializing in UX design. How far have I 
come along? I'm about like three years in,  

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.560
three and a half years. I'm almost done. 
I have about a year and a half left,  

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.680
so hopefully all will go well. How many 
credits am I taking so far? About 11. I  

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.160
know it's not 12, but it's still kind of a 
big workload, so hopefully I can take it."

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.400
" Where am I working currently? I am currently 
working at Nickel City. So if you guys know me,  

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.960
definitely come by and I can get you guys 
in for free. Obviously you gotta talk to me  

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.800
while I'm working. I don't think you 
can get in for free if I'm not there."
